1. What are you hoping to find in your next position that would make us the right next step
   in your career?

I’m looking for a company that truly cares about its employees, fosters a strong and healthy engineering culture, and has technically skilled professionals I can learn from. I'm drawn to environments with meaningful challenges, where proactivity is encouraged, and where there's room for both personal and professional growth.

2. What have you learned so far about us that has excited you?

From the conversations I’ve had so far with the team, I’ve been impressed by the strong culture, the exciting challenges ahead, and the company’s growth trajectory. I really like your async-first approach, the autonomy and responsibility given to teams. And about the product of Lawnstarter is building, it’s something I would use myself and would definitely hire to my parents as well.

3. Have you worked in an environment where developers own delivering features all the way to
   production? We have QA (Quality Assurance) and a Product Operations team, however, they exist
   to provide support to engineers. Are you comfortable going to a place where the quality buck stops
   with the engineers and you have the ability to deploy and observe your own code in production?

Yes! In my current role, engineers are responsible for the entire lifecycle of a feature — from product ideation (with product team), database modeling, to implementing microservices, coding. testing, deploying to production, and maintaining observability. This level of ownership is exactly what I look for in a company. It keeps engineers close to the product and involved from beginning to end of the product, which I believe leads to better outcomes and stronger motivation.

4. What is the next technology or subject you are hoping to learn about?

I’m very interested in learning more about artificial intelligence. While I’ve already started exploring the subject, I haven’t had the opportunity to dive deeply into it yet. AI is already becoming a part of our everyday lives, and as engineers, I believe it’s essential that we stay up-to-date with these advances.

PS: I’m writing this at 4 A.M., even though I usually go to bed around 11 P.M. — just to show how much I want this opportunity and how focused I am on making it happen.
